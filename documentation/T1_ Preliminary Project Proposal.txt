Assignment T1: Preliminary Project Proposal


Part 1:
* Nothing has changed.


Part 2:
1. What will our service do? What kind of functionality or features will it provide? 


Our service allows users to query for songs and returns related information (lyrics, singer, etc.). 


Service that allows clients to edit code/text collaboratively in real time (like google docs). It makes revisions available during a period without requests. 


2. Who or what will be its users?  What might they use the functionality for?  


The intended users are the developers of various IDEs/text editors (like VSCode) or business tools like Microsoft Office. These users will use the functionality for developing real-time collaboration capabilities. 


3. What kind of data will your service create or accumulate?  What will the data be used for?


Part 3:
1. How will you test that your service does what it is supposed to do and provides the intended functionality?  


2. How will you check that your service does not behave badly if its clients use it in unintended ways or provide invalid inputs? 


3. How will you test that your service handles its data the way it's supposed to?
